Clone the repository:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gold-price-predictor.git\n   cd gold-price-predictor\n   ```\n\n2. Create and activate a virtual environment:\n   ```\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n3. Install the required dependencies:\n   ```\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n4. Run the Flask application:\n   ```\n   python app.py\n   ```\n\n5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n1. **Predict Gold Prices**: \n   - Fill in the form on the homepage with the required input features (Open, High, Low, Volume).\n   - Click \"Predict\" to get the predicted gold price.\n\n2. **Backtesting**:\n   - Click the \"Run Backtest\" button to perform backtesting on all implemented models.\n   - View the results, including MSE, Sharpe Ratio, and Total Return for each model.\n\n3. **Visualization**:\n   - Click on the \"View Gold Price Chart\" link to see a visualization of historical gold prices.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTo run the unit tests:\n\n```\npytest tests/\n```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n- `app.py`: Main Flask application\n- `src/`: Source code for data fetching, model training, and backtesting\n- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface\n- `tests/`: Unit tests\n- `config.json`: Configuration file for data fetching and model parameters\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details on our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the `LICENSE` file for details.","tool_call_id":"toolu_011Dz2MSCbo4SC3HbrHSKXbH","is_error":false,"timestamp":"2024-08-31T19:49:39.367Z"}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Based on the README.md, we can conclude:\n\n1. The project is actually a Gold Price Predictor, not a Forex predictor as initially assumed.\n2. It's a web application built with Flask that uses machine learning models to predict gold prices.\n3. The application offers features like price prediction, backtesting, and visualization of historical gold prices.\n4. It uses a virtual environment for Python and has dependencies listed in requirements.txt.\n5. The project has a structured layout with separate directories for source code, templates, tests, and configuration.\n6. It includes instructions for setup, usage, and running tests.\n7. The project is open for contributions and is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nIn summary, the imaginative-goose-01 repository contains a Gold Price Predictor web application. It uses machine learning models to predict gold prices and provides additional features like backtesting and visualization.
